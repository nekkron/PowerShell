The church says the earth is flat, but I know that it is round, for I have seen the shadow on the moon, and I have more faith in a shadow than in the church. - Ferdinand Magellan
I don't think there's any difference between the pope wearing a large hat and parading around with a smoking purse, and an African painting his face white and praying to a rock. - Howard Stern
I prefer rationalism to atheism. The question of God and other objects-of-faith are outside reason and play no part in rationalism, thus you don't have to waste your time in either attacking or defending. - Isaac Asimov (1920 - 1992)
Fix reason firmly in her seat, and call to her tribunal every fact, every opinion. Question with boldness even the existence of a God; because, if there be one, he must more approve of the homage of reason, than that of blindfolded fear. - Thomas Jefferson

Shepherds don't look after sheep because they love them - although I do think some shepherds like their sheep too much. They look after their sheep so they can, first, fleece them and second, turn them into meat. That's much more like the priesthood as I know it. - Christopher Hitchens (1949 - 2011)
I can't say that it's the Koran that causes a husband to beat his wife, but when I was a translator in Holland and we condemned some men for beating their wives, they would pull out the Koran and say, 'Look here, Chapter 4, Verse 34, gives me a reason, and in fact even obligates me, to beat my wife if she's disobedient.' - Ayaan Hirsi Ali
I cannot imagine a God who rewards and punishes the objects of his creation, whose purposes are modelled after our own - a God, in short, who is but a reflection of human frailty.

It was, of course, a lie what you read about my religious convictions, a lie which is being systematically repeated.

By all means let an observant Jewish adult male have his raw-cut penis placed in the mouth of a rabbi.

Learn to shorten your reach. If your foe can come close enough to negate your striking power, all strategem is lost. And when all strategem is lost, the battle is lost. - O'Shovah

The idea of a personal God is quite alien to me and seems even naive. - Albert Einstein (1879 - 1955)
The Christian resolution to find the world ugly and bad has made the world ugly and bad. - Friedrich Nietzsche
The philosopher has never killed any priests, whereas the priest has killed a great many philosophers. - Denis Diderot
Religion is regarded by the common people as true, by the wise as false, and by rulers as useful. - Lucius Annaeus Seneca
Religion is like a blind man looking in a black room for a black cat that isn't there, and finding it. - Ancient Viking Proverb
The word 'heretic' comes from the Greek word 'hairetikos' meaning 'able to choose' which pretty much says it all. - Pat Condell
